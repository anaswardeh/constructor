<p>
So, this exercise gives us a glimps about object oriented programming. JavaScript is an excellent language to compose OOP web applications. In this exercise we will be exposed to Node.JS module exports. The Module export is a special object which is included in other JS files in the Node.JS application. It is a representation of the constructor that will serve a partial role in the overall application.

<p>
In Letter.JS, the character is stored, then we give it a default boolean state, in this case it is false. Then a function that will replace each letter with an underscore unless it is guess. At this point, the letter will be shown and it will not be represented by an underscore.
